CorpsconUtils
=========

A C# utility library for making calls to the Corpscon.dll for performing coordinate conversions.

This library will require that you have Corpscon 6 installed and reference the correct file paths for the Corpscon.dll and the data files.  

I didn't write calls to all of the functions since for my purposes there are several functions that I won't ever need to use.  

I've not yet tested this to much extent so use at your own risk.
